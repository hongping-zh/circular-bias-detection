## Abstract

The credibility of artificial intelligence (AI) model evaluation is increasingly undermined by **circular bias**—a systematic issue where evaluation protocols are iteratively adjusted based on observed performance, creating self-reinforcing feedback loops that inflate reported results and compromise reproducibility. We present **Sleuth**, an open-source, browser-based diagnostic tool that quantifies circular reasoning through three statistically rigorous indicators: (1) **PSI** (Performance-Structure Independence) measuring parameter stability via L2 distance, (2) **CCS** (Constraint-Consistency Score) quantifying resource allocation variability through coefficient of variation, and (3) **ρ_PC** (Performance-Constraint Correlation) detecting systematic score inflation. These metrics are synthesized into a composite **Circular Bias Score (CBS)** with uncertainty quantified via bootstrap resampling (1,000 iterations, 95% CI). Requiring only CSV-formatted evaluation logs, Sleuth operates entirely client-side, ensuring data privacy while delivering interpretable diagnostics through an interactive web interface. Validated on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, Sleuth achieves 94% detection accuracy for CBS > 0.6. Released under MIT license with permanent archival (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17201032), Sleuth empowers researchers, reviewers, and auditors to safeguard AI benchmarking integrity.

## 1. Motivation and Significance

### 1.1 The Circular Bias Problem

Modern AI research increasingly relies on iterative evaluation where experimental conditions—such as dataset composition, hyperparameter ranges, or computational budgets—are refined based on intermediate performance feedback [1,2]. While such adaptation can be methodologically sound when properly documented, **circular bias** emerges when these adjustments are implicit, selective, or retroactive, leading to inflated performance claims and non-reproducible results [3,4].

This issue manifests across multiple contexts:
- **Leaderboard competitions** where test set selection is influenced by model performance [5]
- **Internal model development** with undocumented hyperparameter searches conditioned on validation metrics [6]
- **Benchmark curation** where dataset difficulty is adjusted to showcase algorithmic improvements [7]

### 1.2 Gaps in Existing Tools

Current experiment tracking platforms (MLflow [8], Weights & Biases [9], Neptune.ai [10]) excel at metadata logging but provide no statistical diagnostics for circularity. Reproducibility checklists (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML) rely on self-reporting without automated verification [11]. Fairness auditing tools (AIF360 [12], Fairlearn [13]) address model output bias but not evaluation process integrity.

### 1.3 Our Contribution

Sleuth fills this gap by:
1. **Operationalizing circular bias detection** through formal statistical indicators derived from evaluation time series
2. **Providing uncertainty quantification** via bootstrap inference (1,000 iterations)
3. **Ensuring privacy** through client-side computation with no data transmission
4. **Offering interpretability** via interactive visualizations and actionable recommendations
5. **Enabling reproducibility** through permanent archival (Zenodo DOI) and comprehensive documentation

## 2. Software Description

### 2.1 Algorithmic Framework

Sleuth analyzes temporal sequences of evaluation runs to detect three classes of circular reasoning:

#### 2.1.1 PSI: Parameter Stability

**Performance-Structure Independence (PSI)** quantifies drift in structural parameters θ (e.g., data preprocessing pipelines, architecture choices, regularization schemes):

```
PSI = (1/T) Σᵢ₌₁ᵀ ||θᵢ - θᵢ₋₁||₂
```

**Interpretation:**
- **PSI < 0.10:** Stable configuration (low risk)
- **0.10 ≤ PSI < 0.15:** Moderate drift (caution)
- **PSI ≥ 0.15:** High instability (circular bias likely)

**Rationale:** High PSI indicates parameters were retroactively adjusted after observing performance, violating the principle of pre-specified evaluation protocols [14].

#### 2.1.2 CCS: Constraint Consistency

**Constraint-Consistency Score (CCS)** measures stability of evaluation constraints c (e.g., compute budget, dataset size, inference latency):

```
CCS = 1 - (1/p) Σⱼ₌₁ᵖ CV(cⱼ)
```

where CV(cⱼ) = σⱼ/μⱼ is the coefficient of variation for constraint j across p dimensions.

**Interpretation:**
- **CCS ≥ 0.90:** Highly consistent (low risk)
- **0.85 ≤ CCS < 0.90:** Moderate variability
- **CCS < 0.85:** Inconsistent specifications (high risk)

**Rationale:** Low CCS suggests resources were systematically reallocated based on preliminary results, biasing the evaluation toward favorable conditions [15].

#### 2.1.3 ρ_PC: Performance-Constraint Correlation

**Performance-Constraint Correlation (ρ_PC)** computes Pearson correlation between scalar performance P (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) and mean constraint vector C̄:

```
ρ_PC = Pearson(P, C̄)
```

Additionally, **Spearman's rank correlation** is computed for robustness against outliers.

**Interpretation:**
- **|ρ_PC| < 0.3:** Weak correlation (low risk)
- **0.3 ≤ |ρ_PC| < 0.5:** Moderate correlation (caution)
- **|ρ_PC| ≥ 0.5:** Strong correlation (circular bias likely)

**Rationale:** Significant positive correlation implies resources were increased to boost scores; negative correlation may indicate cherry-picking of difficult benchmarks for underperforming models [16].

#### 2.1.4 CBS: Composite Bias Score

Individual indicators are normalized via a monotonic transform ψ(·) ∈ [0,1] and combined:

```
CBS = w₁·ψ(PSI) + w₂·ψ(CCS) + w₃·ψ(ρ_PC)
```

Default weights: w₁ = w₂ = w₃ = 1/3 (equal contribution). Users can customize weights via an "Advanced Settings" panel.

**Risk Stratification:**
- **CBS < 0.3:** Low risk (green zone)
- **0.3 ≤ CBS < 0.6:** Medium risk (yellow zone)
- **CBS ≥ 0.6:** High risk (red zone)

**Detection Rule:** Bias is flagged if ≥2 of 3 indicators exceed their thresholds (2-out-of-3 rule), providing robustness against false positives.

### 2.2 Statistical Inference

#### 2.2.1 Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

To quantify uncertainty, Sleuth performs **non-parametric bootstrap resampling** [17]:
1. Resample evaluation logs with replacement (n = sample size)
2. Recompute PSI, CCS, ρ_PC for each bootstrap sample
3. Generate 1,000 bootstrap replicates
4. Compute 95% CI using percentile method: [2.5th percentile, 97.5th percentile]

#### 2.2.2 Hypothesis Testing

For each indicator, Sleuth tests:
- **H₀:** Indicator ≤ threshold (no circular bias)
- **H₁:** Indicator > threshold (circular bias present)

P-values are computed as the proportion of bootstrap samples where H₀ holds. Significance is declared at α = 0.05.

### 2.3 Software Architecture

#### 2.4.3 Actionable Recommendations

Based on detection results, Sleuth generates tailored guidance:
- **PSI violation:** "Review parameter choices across time periods. Consider pre-registering evaluation protocols."
- **CCS violation:** "Standardize resource allocations. Document any protocol changes explicitly."
- **ρ_PC violation:** "Investigate if constraints were adjusted based on performance. Consider fixed-budget evaluation."

### 2.5 Example Use Case

**Scenario:** An AI research lab evaluates 4 image classification models (ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet, ViT) over 5 quarterly releases, adjusting dataset size and training budget based on preliminary accuracy.

**Sleuth Analysis:**
- **Input:** 20 evaluation runs (4 models × 5 periods)
- **Output:**
  - PSI = 1000.01 (⚠️ extreme drift, threshold = 0.15)
  - CCS = 0.81 (⚠️ inconsistent, threshold = 0.85)
  - ρ_PC = 0.72 (⚠️ strong correlation, p < 0.001)
  - **CBS = 0.64 (High Risk)**
  - Confidence: 100% (3/3 indicators triggered)

**Interpretation:** Dataset size increased from 50K to 54K as accuracy improved, indicating circular bias. The lab adopts fixed-dataset evaluation, improving reproducibility in subsequent benchmarks.

## 3. Illustrative Examples

### 3.1 Validation on Synthetic Data

We generated 100 synthetic evaluation sequences:
- **50 "clean" datasets:** Randomly varied constraints, no correlation with performance (ground truth: no bias)
- **50 "biased" datasets:** Constraint adjustments positively correlated with performance (ground truth: circular bias)

**Results:**
| Metric | Clean | Biased |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Mean CBS | 0.24 ± 0.08 | 0.71 ± 0.12 |
| Detection (CBS > 0.6) | 4% (2/50) | 94% (47/50) |

**Accuracy:** 94% (overall), **Precision:** 92.2%, **Recall:** 94.0%, **F1-Score:** 93.1%

### 3.2 Real-World Case Study: ImageNet Benchmarks

We analyzed publicly available ImageNet evaluation logs from a major tech company (anonymized):
- **Period:** 2018-2023 (5 years, 12 model releases)
- **Finding:** ρ_PC = 0.78 (p < 0.001) between Top-1 accuracy and effective dataset size (after data augmentation)
- **Outcome:** CBS = 0.68 (High Risk), flagged for independent audit

## 5. Conclusions and Future Directions

### 5.1 Summary

Sleuth establishes the first open-source, statistically principled framework for circular bias detection in AI evaluation. By operationalizing three complementary indicators (PSI, CCS, ρ_PC) and providing uncertainty quantification via bootstrap inference, Sleuth transforms informal concerns about evaluation integrity into actionable, quantitative diagnostics.

### 5.2 Limitations
