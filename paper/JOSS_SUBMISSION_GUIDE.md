   Sleuth is a browser-based tool for detecting circular bias in AI evaluation. 
   It provides statistical diagnostics (PSI, CCS, œÅ_PC, CBS) with bootstrap 
   uncertainty quantification to identify self-reinforcing evaluation patterns 
   that inflate performance metrics. The tool operates client-side for data 
   privacy and has been validated with 94% accuracy on synthetic datasets.
   ```

1. **Automated Checks** (~5 minutes)
   - JOSS bot verifies repository structure
   - Checks for required files
   - Validates paper.md format

2. **Editor Assignment** (~1-2 days)
   - An editor reviews your submission
   - Assigns 2 reviewers

3. **Review Process** (~2-4 weeks)
   - Reviewers post comments on a public GitHub Issue
   - You respond and make improvements
   - Very collaborative and transparent!

4. **Acceptance** (~1 month total)
   - Once reviewers approve
   - Paper is published with DOI
   - Completely free!

## üìã Expected Reviewer Questions

**Be prepared to address:**

1. **"Can you add more examples to README?"**
   - Your README is already comprehensive, should be fine

2. **"Can you add installation instructions?"**
   - Mention it's browser-based (no installation needed)
   - Provide link to live demo

3. **"Can you add automated tests?"**
   - Your tests/ directory should have some tests
   - If not, you might need to add basic unit tests

4. **"Can you add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md?"**

   - Can use standard Contributor Covenant template

5. **"Can you improve documentation?"**
