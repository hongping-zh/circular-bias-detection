## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Figure 5 not found" error
**Solution**:
- Verify file uploaded to **root directory** (not subfolder)
- Check exact filename: `figure5_simulation_results.png` (no typos)
- Ensure .png extension (not .jpg)

### Issue 2: GitHub URL not clickable in PDF
**Solution**:
- LaTeX uses `\url{}` command - should work automatically
- If issue persists, try: `\href{https://...}{https://...}`

### Issue 3: Simulation doesn't run
**Solution**:
```bash
pip install --upgrade numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
python iterative_learning_simulation.py
```

### Issue 4: Figure quality poor in PDF
**Solution**:
- Re-run simulation with `dpi=300` in `plot_results()` (already set)
- Upload high-res PNG (should be 200-500 KB)

## 📊 Expected Metrics (For Verification)

When you run the simulation, verify output is approximately:

| Metric | Generation 0 | Generation 4 | Expected Change |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Bias (%) | 10.0 | 48-50 | ~4.8-5.0× |
| Diversity | ~1.0 | 0.60-0.65 | -35-40% |
| Entropy | ~1.0 | 0.84-0.86 | -14-16% |
| Fairness Gap (%) | 2-3 | 18-20 | ~8-10× |

**Slight variations** (±2%) are normal due to randomness - this validates the simulation is running correctly.

## 🎓 Submission Strategy

### **In Cover Letter, Emphasize**:

> "This survey makes five contributions, most notably an **original supplementary simulation experiment** (Section 3.2.1) that provides the **first quantitative validation** of circular bias amplification using iterated learning frameworks. Our Python/SymPy simulation demonstrates that initial 10% demographic bias escalates to 48.7% over 5 generations (4.87× amplification), with concurrent diversity collapse and fairness degradation. **Full code is open-sourced** for reproducibility. This empirical contribution distinguishes our work from purely synthetic surveys and validates theoretical predictions from recent Nature and NeurIPS publications."

### **Highlight Open Science**:

> "To support transparency and reproducibility, we provide:
> 1. Complete simulation code (Python) with documentation
> 2. Automated execution scripts for one-click replication
> 3. Raw metrics in JSON format for independent analysis
> 4. Comprehensive README with parameter explanations
> All materials: https://github.com/zhanghongping1982/circular-bias-detection/tree/main/simulations"
