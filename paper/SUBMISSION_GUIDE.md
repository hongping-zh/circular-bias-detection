#### **Title (Copy-paste this):**
```
Sleuth: A Browser-Based Tool for Detecting Circular Bias in AI Evaluation
```

#### **Abstract (Copy-paste this):**
```
Evaluation integrity in artificial intelligence (AI) systems faces a critical challenge: circular bias occurs when assessment protocols undergo iterative modifications influenced by observed outcomes, generating self-reinforcing patterns that artificially enhance reported metrics while undermining reproducibility. This paper introduces Sleuth, an open-access browser tool that employs statistical rigor to identify circular reasoning patterns through three diagnostic measures: PSI evaluates parameter consistency using L2 distance metrics, CCS assesses resource allocation stability via coefficient of variation, and œÅ_PC detects systematic performance-resource coupling through correlation analysis. These indicators merge into a unified Circular Bias Score (CBS) complemented by bootstrap uncertainty estimation (1,000 replications, 95% confidence bounds). Operating exclusively on client-side infrastructure with CSV log inputs, Sleuth preserves data confidentiality while generating actionable diagnostics through visual interfaces. Empirical validation demonstrates 94% detection accuracy across synthetic and authentic benchmark scenarios. Distributed under CC BY 4.0 licensing with permanent repository archival, Sleuth equips academic researchers, peer reviewers, and compliance auditors with systematic tools for protecting assessment quality.
