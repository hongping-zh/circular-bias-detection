# Glossary
- Circular Bias: Results inflated by iterative protocol changes.
- PSI (Parameter Stability Index): Stability of parameters across periods.
- CCS (Constraint Consistency Score): Consistency of evaluation constraints.
- ρ_PC (Performance-Constraint Correlation): Correlation of performance and constraints.
- Bootstrap: Resampling to estimate CI and p-values.
- Adaptive Thresholds: Data-driven cutoffs (e.g., 95th percentile).
- Evaluation Protocol: Fixed, pre-registered settings during evaluation.
- Client-side (Pyodide): Python in browser; data stays local.
