# Glossary

- Circular Bias: Results inflated by iterative changes to evaluation protocol.
- PSI (Parameter Stability Index): Measures parameter stability across periods.
- CCS (Constraint Consistency Score): Measures consistency of evaluation constraints.
- ρ_PC (Performance-Constraint Correlation): Correlation between performance and constraints.
- Bootstrap: Resampling method to estimate CI and p-values.
- Adaptive Thresholds: Data-driven thresholds (e.g., 95th percentile).
- Evaluation Protocol: Fixed, pre-registered settings during evaluation.
- Client-side (Pyodide): Python runs fully in browser; data stays local.
